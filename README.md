Given a person’s age, calculate how old that person would be on different planets.<br>

For simplicity’s sake, here’s a list of planets and their orbit times.<br>

Earth: Orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31,557,600 seconds<br>
Mercury: Orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years<br>
Venus: Orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years<br>
Mars: Orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years<br>
Jupiter: Orbital period 11.862615 Earth years<br>
Saturn: Orbital period 29.447498 Earth years<br>
Uranus: Orbital period 84.016846 Earth years<br>
Neptune: Orbital period 164.79132 Earth years<br>
And, depending on your feelings towards Pluto...<br>
Pluto: Orbital period 248.00 Earth years<br>
<br>
So, if you were told someone was 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31 Earth years old.<br>
